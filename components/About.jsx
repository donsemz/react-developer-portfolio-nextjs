          <p className='py-2 text-gray-600'>
            I specialize in building fullstack applications which feature aspects
            of both the front-end (Client) and back-end (Server). I’m
            passionate about learning new technologies and understand there is
            more than one way to accomplish a task. Though I am most proficient
            in building fullstack applications using C#, Python and
            React, I am a quick learner and can pick up new tech stacks as
            needed. I believe that being a great developer is not using one
            specific language, but choosing the best tool for the job.
          </p>

            I started web developement in 2016 developing a variety of Websites
            on the front-end, back-end and testing side. I have experience working directly with teams and taking
            mock wireframes all the way to deployed applications. In my spare
            time I love reading, researching and exercising. I have a passion for learning and engaging in new technologies.
